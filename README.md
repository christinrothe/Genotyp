# Human Algorithm

This project is based on the course "Input/Output" by Fabian Móron Zirfas.

## Human Algorithm
Write a step-by-step instruction how to paint a specific pattern. Let people complete this task without any help or advice.

## My pattern
I created a complex and static pattern. My goal was, to recreate these shapes identical in size, implementation and appearance with the algorithm.

## Outcome
Most people had trouble in recreating the pattern I gave. The reason for this is to find on both sides: the drawers and mine.
mine:
not detailed enough
no keywords used
syntax
shortcuts
too many alternatives

drawer:
no tools (red pen, ruler…)
not concentrated
different understanding
propper reading
