## Human Algorithm

This project is based on the course "Input/Output" by Fabian Móron Zirfas.

### Human Algorithm
Write a step-by-step instruction how to paint a specific pattern. Let people complete this task without any help or advice.

### My pattern
I created a complex and static pattern. My goal was, to recreate these shapes identical in size, implementation and appearance with the algorithm.

### Outcome
Most people had trouble in recreating the pattern I gave. The reason for this is to find on both sides: the drawers and mine.

mine:
- not detailed enough
- no keywords used
- syntax
- shortcuts
- too many alternatives

drawer:
- no tools (red pen, ruler…)
- not concentrated
- different understanding
- propper reading
