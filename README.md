## Human Algorithm

This project is based on the course "Input/Output" by Fabian Móron Zirfas.

### Human Algorithm
Write a step-by-step instruction how to paint a specific pattern. Let people complete this task without any help or advice.

### My pattern
I created a complex and static pattern. My goal was, to recreate these shapes identical in size, implementation and appearance with the algorithm.

### Outcome
Most people had trouble in recreating the pattern I gave. The reason for this is to find on both sides: the drawers and mine.

mine:
- not detailed enough
- no keywords used
- syntax
- shortcuts
- too many alternatives

drawer:
- no tools (red pen, ruler…)
- not concentrated
- different understanding
- propper reading

###development
Because the pattern is so fragmented and static, I decided to reduce it to the most interesting and changeable shape. The bent line is simple but opens a lot of creative space. 

###harmonograph
While my research, I found the harmonograph code on the web, which fascinated me a lot. It works just like the mechanical apparatus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonograph) creating drawings of curves in great complexity.
I used this snipped of code and the speed of the computer, to bring the simple bent line to a variety of drawings in just a blink.

###Application
I used the grid as a painting for pottery. The grid is also influencing the shape of the bowl and gives a nice texture.
This technique can be used to create personlaized pottery for specific dishes eg. japanese ramen.
